CSC3022H Assignment 1

Files and their workings:
The following files make up the program:

 - driver.cpp/.h              : Contains main method and menu loop
 - database.cpp/.h          : Database object that contains the menu methods.
 - Makefile                 : The makefile for the project
 - db.txt                     : An example text file using commas to delimit values

 How to compile, run and clean:
  In terminal:
    make - to compile
    make run - to compile and run
    make clean - to clean

  Assumptions:
    1)  To check for duplicates before inserting the database must first be read.
        If data is entered before the database is loaded the program will not pick up duplicates.

    2)  Before the database can be saved it must first be loaded.
        The program will not allow a save command before a load command.
